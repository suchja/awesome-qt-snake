# Hello (again) Qt and C++ World
Its been a while since my last contact with C++ and I've never made a deep dive into Qt. Although I had some contact. Now is the time to visit this world again and see whether it thrills me enough to work as a C++ developer. This project should serve the following purposes:
1. Get to know the current version of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and its ecosystem
2. See how quickly my rusty C++ skills become active again
3. Show how I usually develop (as far as that is possible with such a simple example)
4. Document my "learnings" (based on the Today I Learned (TIL) approach as seen by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til))

## Workflow / Development Lifecycle
As stated in the previous section, one purpose of this project is to show case my way of tackling a development task. For this project I decided to go with some agility in mind:
- Understand requirements by defining user stories.
- Ensure a certain quality (with regards to functional and non-functional requirements) by using a test-driven approach.
- Ensure there is always an executable and versioned product by following the "GitHub Flow" approach
- Use traceability between requirements and code changes. This supports me and potential helpers during maintenance.
- Document key decisions, but use clean and solid code as the core documentation.
- Create spikes (prototypes) for learning and throw them away.
- Use state of the art technology, but generally keep the code as simple as possible so that unexperienced developers can understand the code easily.
- Use an incremental development approach so that a continuous evaluation is possible.
