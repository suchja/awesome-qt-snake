# Hello (again) Qt and C++ World
Its been a while since my last contact with C++ and I've never made a deep dive into Qt. Although I had some contact. Now is the time to visit this world again and see whether it thrills me enough to work as a C++ developer. This project should serve the following purposes:
1. Get to know the current version of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and its ecosystem
2. See how quickly my rusty C++ skills become active again
3. Show how I usually develop (as far as that is possible with such a simple example)
4. Document my "learnings" (based on the Today I Learned (TIL) approach as seen by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til))
